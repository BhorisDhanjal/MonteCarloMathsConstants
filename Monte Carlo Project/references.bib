The construction is based on the theory of (t, s)-sequences. It is also shown that the dispersion of the sequences constructed here has the smallest possible order of magnitude among any sequences in the s-dimensional unit cube.}

abstract = {This paper studies several well-known families of (t,s)-sequences. First we determine the exact t-value of Niederreiter sequences. Then we analyze the exact t-value of generalized Niederreiter sequences and we show that, for a range of dimensions of practical interest, Niederreiter–Xing sequences are demonstrably better than Sobol’ sequences in terms of the exact t-value. Previously, such a conclusion was not possible since only upper bounds on the exact t-value of these sequences and a general lower bound for all (t,s)-sequences were available.}

 abstract = {The method of antithetic variates is a well known technique for reducing the variability of estimators in computer simulation experiments. It is shown that in many, if not most simulations, the usually suggested way of applying the method suffers from two weaknesses. One is so serious that it can lead to estimators which are worse than if the technique is not used at all. Simple alternatives are suggested which do not suffer either weakness. A numerical example is given illustrating the advantages of these alternative procedures.},
